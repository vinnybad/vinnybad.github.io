Hi!  I'm Vinny. I'm a full-stack engineer, with a soft spot for iOS development...it's a lot of fun!  

I like to discover new music, volunteer my dev skills for a not-for-profit org, and love biking.  

I started this blog as a way to keep pushing myself to learn more as a Software Engineer.  I've also benefited greatly from reading others' blogs and figure I should give back to the community.  

I hope you find the information here useful.  This is still an experiment, so if you find it useful, please be sure to drop me a line!
