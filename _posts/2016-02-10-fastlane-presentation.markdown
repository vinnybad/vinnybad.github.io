I gave a presentation at Chicago's Cocoaheads yesterday about Fastlane.  It simplifies your dev and release workflows, whether you are part of a bigger organization or you are an indie developer.  

You can [download the presentation here]({{ site.url }}/assets/files/fastlane-feb-8-2016.key).

I'll write a nicer blog post about fastlane when I get more time.
